We're a group of FOSS enhusiasts, working on some projects. Main languages used: **C#**, **C++**, **F#**.



### AngouriMath

[**AngouriMath**](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath) is a symbolic algebra library for working with math expressions. It is the only actively-maintained and developed symbolic algebra library for .NET. Allows to perform math operations (calculus, linear algebra, boolean logic, set operations), parse expressions and build their LaTeX representation, and more. Suited for C# and F#.

### GenericTensor

<img src="https://github.com/asc-community/GenericTensor/raw/master/ico1.png" width="120" align="left">

[**GenericTensor**](https://github.com/asc-community/GenericTensor) is a library for working with generic multi-dimensional arrays and perform some matrix operations on them. The type of elements of those arrays is arbitrary, all the operations rely on a special "provider" of operations (for example, to perform addition of two arrays, there should be a method which adds `T` and `T` defined).

It is also well-optimized as much as possible given that it still supports any type.
