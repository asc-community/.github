We're a group of FOSS enhusiasts, working on some projects. We genuinely think that OSS is our real bright future. There is no requirement to start contributing to our projects. Moreover, by contributing to them, you contribute to humanity.

Main languages used: **C#**, **C++**, **F#**. [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ASC-Community) and [GitHub](https://github.com/asc-community) of Angouri.

[**AngouriMath**](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath) is a symbolic algebra library for working with math expressions. It is the only actively-maintained and developed symbolic algebra library for .NET. Allows to perform math operations (calculus, linear algebra, boolean logic, set operations), parse expressions and build their LaTeX representation, and more. Suited for C# and F#.

Read more on its [**website**](https://am.angouri.org/).

[**GenericTensor**](https://github.com/asc-community/GenericTensor) is a library for working with generic multi-dimensional arrays and perform some matrix operations on them. The type of elements of those arrays is arbitrary, all the operations rely on a special "provider" of operations (for example, to perform addition of two arrays, there should be a method which adds `T` and `T` defined).

It is also well-optimized as much as possible given that it still supports any type.

[**Honk#**](https://github.com/WhiteBlackGoose/HonkSharp) is a general purpose library for C# aimed to make declarative programming in C# eaiser. It provides a number of fluent method extensions, for example, method `Pipe`, lazy properties, anonymous union type. Might fit well projects which cannot be afforded to be rewritten in more declarative languages, but at the same time would benefit from such features.
